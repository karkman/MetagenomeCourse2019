# Metagenomics

## General introduction
Microbial community structure and diversity, and population structure are fundamental aspects to understand evolution, niche adaptation and demographic history of bacterial species. As NGS sequencing has become cost effective and accessible, analysis of genetic content of microbial communities through metagenomics has become the mainstream methodology. During the one week course the students will learn and apply bioinformatic techniques to study microbial communities with metagenomic approaches. The goal is to become familiar with the bioinformatic analysis tools and to be able to utilize them in own research after the course.

**Everything is possible thanks to the support of CSC**

## [Schedule](https://github.com/karkman/MetagenomeCourse2019/blob/master/ScheduleofCourse.md)
The course will be held at the Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry, University of Helsinki.
* **Monday to Friday**: [metagenomics](https://github.com/karkman/MetagenomeCourse2019/blob/master/Metagenomics.md)

### Monday
- [ ] Introduction
- [ ]  [Setup](MetagenomeInstallations.md)
- [ ]  [Data download and QC](MetagenomePart1.md)
- [ ]  [Assembly](MetagenomePart1.md#assembly)
- [ ]  [Taxonomic annotation](MetagenomePart1.md#taxonomic-profiling-with-metaxa2)

## Place
* Infocenter room Info4.

## Target group
This course is targeted at PhD and MSc students who are interested in using metagenomics for investigating microbial communities. Before attending the course students need to pass Linux self-learning course held in April. 

## Learning outcomes
QA/QC of the raw sequence data, cleaning and assembly; Gene-by-gene annotation; Visualization of data; Taxonomic classification; Functional assignment, Analyses of microbial community composition; Comparative metagenomics; MAG (MetagenomeAssembledGenome) analysis.
